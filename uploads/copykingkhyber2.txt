"Another sign!" she laughed. "The gods love me! There always is a
sign when I need one! Slow of resolution, art thou? I will speed thy

him up the wooden box that
King had used to stand on; he seized it in
both hands with a grin and a jest
and went to stand behind King and
Ismail, in line with the lashless mullah, facing Yasmini. Yasmini smiled
at them all as if they were actors in her comedy, and she well pleased
